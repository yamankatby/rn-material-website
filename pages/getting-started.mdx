# Getting started

Add **rn-material** to your project in < 1 minute.

## Installation

Open a Terminal in your project's folder and run:

```bash
npm install rn-material
```

_or with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):_

```bash
yarn add rn-material
```

## Quick start

Here's a quick example to get you started, **it's literally all you need**:

```jsx
import { Button } from "rn-material";

const App = () => (
  <Button title="Click Me" onPress={() => alert("🎉🎉🎉")} />
);

export default App;
```

Yes, this really is all you need to get started 🎉.

## Set up Provider

For **rn-material** to work currently, you need to wrap your whole app with a [`Provider`]() component.

> This will usually be in the `App.js` or `App.tsx` file.

Go to the root component of your app and add the following:

```jsx
// 1. Import the `Provider` component from `rn-material`
import { Provider } from "rn-material";

const App = () => (
  // 2. Wrap your app with the `Provider` component
  <Provider>
    <Main />
  </Provider>
);

export default App;
```

The [`Provider`]() component provides the theme context to all components in the library. It also acts as a portal to
components which need to be rendered at the top level (such as dialogs, popups, etc.).

Refer to the [Theming](/guides/theming) documentation for more information.
