npm install @react-native-material/core
```

Then start using the power of Material Design in your React Native app.

```js with-preview name: Quick start; description: A simple example of the button component
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "@react-native-material/core";

const App = () => (
  <Button title="Click Me" style={{ alignSelf: "center", marginTop: 40 }}/>
);

export default App;
```
